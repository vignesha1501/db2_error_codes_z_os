DB2 error code -101 indicates a syntax error in an SQL statement. Here's a detailed explanation of what DB2 error code -101 means:

### SQL0101N Error Code Explanation:

**SQL0101N** "The statement is too long or too complex."

- **Cause**: This error occurs when an SQL statement exceeds the maximum allowable length or complexity limits defined by the DB2 database system.

- **Example**: There can be various scenarios leading to error code -101:
  - A single SQL statement that is too lengthy due to a large number of columns in `SELECT` clause, numerous joins, or extensive use of subqueries.
  - A complex SQL statement that involves multiple nested queries or operations, exceeding the database's capability to parse and execute it efficiently.

- **Resolution**: To resolve this error, consider the following steps:
  - **Simplify SQL Statements**: Break down complex SQL statements into smaller, more manageable queries.
  - **Optimize Queries**: Review the SQL statement to eliminate unnecessary complexity, such as redundant joins or subqueries.
  - **Use Views or Stored Procedures**: Consider using database views or stored procedures to encapsulate complex logic and reduce the complexity of SQL statements executed directly.

- **Usage**: This error is encountered in applications where SQL statements are dynamically generated or in scenarios involving complex data retrieval or manipulation requirements.

### Summary:
DB2 error code -101, SQL0101N, indicates a syntax error caused by an SQL statement that is too long or too complex for the DB2 database system to process effectively. By simplifying and optimizing SQL queries, you can avoid encountering this error and ensure efficient database operations in DB2 environments.
