DB2 error code -007 indicates a problem related to invalid characters in SQL statements. Here's a detailed explanation of what DB2 error code -007 means:

### SQL007N Error Code Explanation:

**SQL007N** "Unacceptable character 'character' found in SQL statement."

- **Cause**: This error occurs when an SQL statement contains one or more characters that are not valid within the context of SQL syntax or within identifiers (such as table names, column names, etc.).

- **Example**: Consider the following SQL query:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'John's data';
  ```
  In this example, the single quote (`'`) within `'John's data'` is causing DB2 to raise error code -007 because it interprets the single quote as the end of the string literal, leading to an invalid SQL statement.

- **Resolution**: To resolve this error, you should correct the SQL statement to ensure that all characters used are valid according to SQL syntax rules. Common solutions include:
  - Escaping special characters using escape sequences (e.g., `\'` for a single quote within a string literal).
  - Using parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid directly embedding values that might contain special characters.

- **Usage**: This error commonly occurs when there are typographical errors or improper use of characters within SQL statements, especially in applications where SQL queries are dynamically generated or constructed.

### Summary:
DB2 error code -007, SQL007N, indicates an issue with the presence of unacceptable characters in an SQL statement. Ensuring proper handling of special characters and adherence to SQL syntax rules helps prevent this error when writing or executing SQL queries in DB2 databases.
