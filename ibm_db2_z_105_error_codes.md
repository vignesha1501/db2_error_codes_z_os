DB2 error code -105 indicates a syntax error in the SQL statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of what DB2 error code -105 means:

### SQL0105N Error Code Explanation:

**SQL0105N** "The statement is too long or too complex."

- **Cause**: This error occurs when an SQL statement exceeds the maximum allowable length or complexity limits defined by the DB2 database system. This is similar to error code -101 (SQL0101N), which also deals with statement length or complexity issues.

- **Example**: Like error code -101, error code -105 can occur due to:
  - A single SQL statement that is too lengthy because of a large number of columns in `SELECT` clause, numerous joins, or extensive use of subqueries.
  - A complex SQL statement involving multiple nested queries or operations, exceeding the database's capability to parse and execute it efficiently.

- **Resolution**: To resolve DB2 error code -105, follow similar steps as for error code -101:
  - **Simplify SQL Statements**: Break down complex SQL statements into smaller, more manageable queries.
  - **Optimize Queries**: Review the SQL statement to eliminate unnecessary complexity, such as redundant joins or subqueries.
  - **Use Views or Stored Procedures**: Consider using database views or stored procedures to encapsulate complex logic and reduce the complexity of SQL statements executed directly.

- **Usage**: This error is typically encountered in applications where SQL statements are dynamically generated or in scenarios involving complex data retrieval or manipulation requirements.

### Summary:
DB2 error code -105, SQL0105N, indicates a syntax error due to an SQL statement that exceeds the maximum allowable length or complexity for the DB2 database system. By simplifying and optimizing SQL queries, you can avoid encountering this error and ensure efficient database operations in DB2 environments.
