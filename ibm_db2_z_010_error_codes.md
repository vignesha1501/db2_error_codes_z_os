DB2 error code -010 indicates a problem with string constants or literals in SQL statements. Here's a detailed explanation of what DB2 error code -010 means:

SQL010N Error Code Explanation:
SQL010N "String constant beginning with string is not terminated properly."

Cause: This error occurs when there is an issue with the syntax of a string constant in an SQL statement. Specifically, it indicates that a string literal within the SQL statement is not properly terminated.

Example: Consider the following SQL query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'value;
In this example, the single quote (') after 'value is missing, which leads to DB2 raising error code -010 because it cannot interpret where the string constant ends.

Resolution: To resolve this error, you should correct the SQL statement to ensure that all string constants or literals are properly terminated with a closing single quote ('). For example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'value';
Adding the closing single quote (') after 'value' properly terminates the string constant, resolving the error.

Usage: This error commonly occurs in SQL statements where string literals are used without proper syntax or when there are typographical errors in the SQL code.

Summary:
DB2 error code -010, SQL010N, indicates an issue with the syntax of string constants or literals in SQL statements, specifically pointing out that a string constant is not correctly terminated. Ensuring proper syntax and formatting of string literals helps prevent this error when writing SQL queries for DB2 databases.
