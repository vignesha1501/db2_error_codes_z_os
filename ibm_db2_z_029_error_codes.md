DB2 error code -029 indicates a specific issue related to SQL statements involving the INTO clause. Here's a detailed explanation of what DB2 error code -029 means:

SQL029N Error Code Explanation:
SQL029N "INTO clause required."

Cause: This error occurs when an SQL statement that requires a result set to be returned to the application does not include an INTO clause to specify where the result set should be stored.

Example: Consider the following SQL query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
If this query is executed in a context where it expects to return results to the application (such as in embedded SQL or stored procedures), but it lacks an INTO clause, DB2 will raise error code -029.

Resolution: To resolve this error, you need to modify the SQL statement to include an appropriate INTO clause that specifies where the result set should be fetched or stored. For example:

sql
Copy code
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR
  SELECT column1, column2 INTO :host_variable1, :host_variable2
  FROM table_name;
In this revised example, :host_variable1 and :host_variable2 are host variables that will hold the fetched values from the result set.

Usage: This error commonly occurs in applications using embedded SQL or stored procedures where developers forget to include the INTO clause when executing queries that return data to the application.

Summary:
DB2 error code -029, SQL029N, indicates a critical requirement in SQL statements where an INTO clause is mandatory for retrieving or handling result sets returned by queries. Ensuring the proper use of INTO clauses in SQL statements is essential for smooth and error-free application execution in DB2 environments.
